  - Approachable guide to build your own free, fast website on GitHub Pages

I've been using Jekyll on GitHub Pages for my website since 2015.

After a couple people have asked how they can try Jekyll, I created this guide!

Even if you don't have coding experience, I've tried to write [this guide](https://www.andrewparadi.com/get-started-with-jekyll/) so that it's approachable for everyone. Give it a try, and [let me know how it can improve](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com?subject=Get Started with Jekyll Feedback).
