**Here's my raw, unedited, 3,004 word notes with actionable insights, case studies, and Q&A from Neil Patel's SEO Webinar on May 26. Please go check him out at NeilPatel.com, it was a great webinar!**

1. How to increase CTR
---

- Use higher CTR to get more clicks and then slowly get more clicks than Google results above you, then you overtake them
- Sign up for Search Console, sit 30 days, collect data to get CTR
- Any CTR less than 4% is not good, mess around with title tag/keywords
	- Use numbers and negative words
	- Title tags with "What is..."
	- Include keywords towards the front
	- Looks at PPC ads for ideas
	- Aim for 6 word title tags
	- Include power words and adjectives
		- Fun, effortless...
	- Evoking curiosity increases clicks

Title tags

- nutritionsecrets.com ranks 1 on "green tea"
	- 10 proven benefits of green tea (no 3 is very impressive)
	- Direct curiosity, buzzfeed/upworthy clickbaity
	- Increased CTR from 4.5% to 5% without changing position
- Good ones
	- "Popular running shoes for women | comfortable running sneakers..."
		- Popular + comfortable, point to value prop
	- "Finding the right dog sitter for your pooch - Dogtime"
	- "Top 24 dog sitter profiles | Linkedin"
	- "DogBuddy: Trusted Dog Sitting & Boarding in the UK
	- "From doctor to dog sitter: Why this MD left the hospital to take... – Seattle"
	- "The best luxury hotels in the world – Five star alliance"
	- "10 of the best luxury hotel brands in the world – Forbes"

2. How to get links from the best publications
---

Publications

- Entrepreneur.com
	- Had
- Forbes.com
	- a
- HuffingtonPost.com
	-
- BrazilPost
	- Didn't even speak english or know him but drives traffic and signups
	- Paid for translation for correspondence emails and articles
- InfoMoney (Bloomberg Brazil)
	-

Why?

- Don't just do it for links, do it for press, leads, and sales

How?

- Don't email the strategy
- Network with other writers, email writers at publication
	- "Hey x, Huge fan of content, love latest post on xyz, few things I would have added/changed. You discuss xyz, but abc would be more useful to your readers. Best of luck, love your articles, didn't mean to be negative, just love seeing you crank out great content. Cheers."
	- Look for other guest writers / guest contributors
	- Use Yesware to track opens try and get responses
	- They usually reply "thanks for tips"
	- Then send them "Hey Jason, checked other article, you did cover abc which is awesome, did you think of covering def, your fan, thanks for keeping up the good work."
	- Send off 3rd email "Hey, have a question, want to follow in footsteps as my career progresses, how can I write on forbes, inc..." they'll intro to editor if you've given them enough tips
	- 30% above works
	- // "Hey I want to do you a huge favour, I'll write the post for you on this topic your readers want, can you intro to editor to "
	- Not as successful since more people are
- Once you have guest account, trade intros and network with other guest writers

Guest Post Rules

- Don't do this just for the links (you'll start to get greedy)
- Don't shove links in your posts
- Don't reuse your content
- Only guest post on relevant sites (focus on the audience you want, ie. not Buzz Feed)
- Write high quality content (content stays there for life so make it good)
- Optimize for keywords

Buffer

- Sent out unique content to 4-10 people "Hi I have post discussing...would you be interest"
- First to reply gets the original
- Next to reply, send back "Just give me an hour, making some awesome edits."

3. International Expansion
---

- English isn't the most popular language
- Chinese, Spanish, English, Hindi
- NP expanding into Portuguese, Spanish, German, Arabic

Why?

- Not as competitive
- Costs less
- See results faster

https://ahrefs.com

How does a basic site get 40k visitors/month?

- 88 pages, no backlinks, no referrals...

Most languages aren't competitive

- Takes 3-6 months to dominate most international markets

Rules

- Translate the content manually (NP paying $100/post to translate entire site)
- Build links from the local region (most don't know about link building or SEO techniques etc so are willing to just give them out)
- Partner with locals
- Include basic content (South America etc don't know about SEO, still wide open field)
- Use hreflang (Tells Google the article comes in multiple languages)
	- Are you targeting language or a country? (Portuguese is different Brazil vs Portugal, Spanish is the same throughout SA)

How

- Google Search Console, add sub section domain.com/br for Brazil
- Click "search traffic" -> "international targeting" -> Choose country/lang targeting
- ONLY do subdirectory for country targeting, not language
- Use subdirectory, not subdomain. Carries more link juice.
- Translated content isn't duplicate

Where to target?

- # of speakers of language
- GDP of country
- How strong is currency? If currency is weak, then you can expand their faster/further for same budget.

4. How to rank for competitive terms
---

- Search "online marketing", NP ranks 4, quicksprout ranks 1, despite many other sites with higher domain authority
- Search "internet marketing" NP has 2 in top 10

How?

- Started years ago making guides, go above beyond with graphics/custom illustrations, 30,000 word content, subsections with long tail keywords, useful to everyone (beginner's and advanced)...etc
- Don't forget to cross link
	- Add sidebars to pages that link to all guides
	- Focus on high quality content (guides)
	- Spend time and money on design
	- Cross link with content and in your sidebar
	- Don't stress about anchor text
	- Only cross link when it makes sense
	- Use an attractive title tag

Title tag vs guide

- Search engine land vs Moz Guide to SEO
	- Moz has way more referring domains
	- SEL has better title tag than Moz, basic content
	- Moz "SEO: The Beginner's Guide to Search Engine Optimization – Moz"
	- SEL "What is SEO / Search Engine Optimization? – Search Engine Land"

Rules

- Link out (link out to other relevant content, often those sites find out and link back or contact them and they might share it)
- Leverage internal links (cross linking)
- Be patient (not going to rank on competitive terms for 3-6 months)


5. How to generate social shares (no ads)
---

- NP right now, 35% Organic Search, 24% social, 19% direct, 17% email, 5% referral.

Stats

- Social drives 80k visitors/m
- Email drives over 60% of social traffic
- Social users are 219% more likely to comment on blog posts
- Social are 2x more likely to link to your site

How?

- Share old articles on FB, Twitter since new users haven't seen them
- Nutrition Secrets did the following and got 35k visitors in 30 days

- For every 1000 words you write, you should link out roughly 25 times (varied amounts based on content of the post to case studies from Harvard, government stats)
	- Don't forget to send an email "Hey John, just wanted to let you know I'm a huge fan of your work. So much that I even linked to you in my latest blog post, xyz.com/bpost. Feel free to share it if you like the post. Your numbers one fan, Mike"
	- Strategy worked really well, people thanked for link, some linked back, others shared
	- Used Yesware to fine-tune copy/subject
	- Send personal emails early morning 6am PST / 9am EST
	- Another template to update blog newsletter "Hey, I just wanted to share with you my latest blog post. Let me know what you think. Why your content isn't generating leads (and how to fix it). 42% of B2B marketers view themselves as successful when it comes to content marketing. However, if you've been grinding away for many months, and you've yet to see results from your content marketing efforts – you may be feeling a little bit frustrated. [click to continue]. Thanks Neil. P.S.: If you want to see how I can help you grow your traffic and revenue, go here."
- Ideal time to share on social web
	- Midweek & weekends, noon & 6pm
- Tweet, Tweet.
	- Buzzsumo.com gives latest top posts ranked by total shares
	- View sharers even shows who tweeted the article
	- Email the sharers for similar topic subj: name of article they shared "Hey NAME, I notice that you tweeted one of my favourite trading posts, "_____?" (from author name). I actually have a content marketing guide that I am sending out next week that is very comprehensive and provides actionable tips. Want a heads up when it goes live? Cheers Neil Patel P.S. Let me know if there is anything I can help you with."
	- When the post goes live send out "Here you go [url] Cheers, Mike Jones" you don't even have to tell them to share
- LinkedIn Groups
	- Join relevant high follower groups, share update to groups

6. Ideal Site Architecture
---

- Google will show Sitelinks if your site architecture is great (ie. the other posts below main domain in search rankings)
- A good structure and site architecture means better crawling

How most people plan their site

- Homepage -> categories -> subcategories -> other pages/posts
- This seems organized but Google searches every link so posts/pages need to link to each other
- Internal/cross linking increases SEO Juice

Rules

- Make site hierarchical
- Keep number of main categories between 2 and 7
- Balance the sub categories within each category
- Use a shallow depth navigation structure
- Add your main sections in your navigation
- Don't forget to cross link (every page/post should have cross links to other internal pages)
- Make your navigation in HTML/CSS

Example

- www.kimsrestaurant.com/locations/chinatown
- Kim's -> Menu, Catering, About, Locations -> Chinatown...

7. Branding
---

- Google Trend to see brand
- Brand is personal names

Strategies

- Focus on press and crazy marketing tactics – Chris Barrett from PR Service
- Leverage social media influences – Dan from Stranger Social
	- Pay $100 for someone with influencer account to post your links on big pages
- Get creative with your ads...
	- Neil had body builders with Neil Patel on their biceps, models, cooks with food spelling Neil Patel...
- Instagram strategy, find influencers and pay them to post with your product
- Gary Vaynerchuk, put phone number on ads for his book and started getting phone calls

Lessons

- You want to run your campaigns all at once
- You need to do this weekly over a period of 2 months
	- Get people to post pictures/images/links "Who is Neil Patel?"
- Rotate up the campaigns
	- Don't just rely on models,
