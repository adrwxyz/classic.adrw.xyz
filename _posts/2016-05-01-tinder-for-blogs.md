**This summer I'm writing a post every week.**

Here's what I've written so far

- [Coding on iPad: Welcome to Reality](/blog/coding-on-ipad)
- [6 Questions to Focus your Resume on Impact](/blog/hired-part-1)
- [Why Your Resume Needs SEO, and How](/blog/hired-part-2)
- [Get More Interviews with This Resume Structure](/blog/hired-part-3)
- [To Achieve Greatness, Don't Settle for Goodness](blog/good-to-great)
- [Hackers, Portfolios, & Camp David](/blog/books-part-3)
- [Blitzen: Signups Up 64% in Weeks](/project/blitzen)

**And you can use Tinder to choose what I write next.**

Each post will answer a *frequently asked question* from friends, classmates, or from the Tinder form below every post.

**I'm stoked to start this journey together!** We're going to travel through different topics and discussions around how to:

- *Land your dream job* – stop missing out on interviews, getting underpaid, and figure out stand out
- *Lead a team or startup like a pro* – stop making rookie mistakes that destroy culture and lead to failure
- *Write applications that secure government grants, win competitions, and land interviews at incubators* – your required first year English course doesn't teach this
- *Manage finances so you can have real freedom for life* – it doesn't even require moving to 'Murica!
- *...and answers to other questions you have!*

**Now like any millennial,** I don't think we need to give this name. There isn't going to be a formal structure to the series or strict commitment to any topic. We don't need to formalize this relationship.

> This is going to be Tinder for Blogs.
